This is an Android app which will allow you to take pictures of your face every day. It will create a video timelapse of your face pictures, which you can upload to YouTube, Facebook, etc.

It allows you to set reminders, track pictures for multiple people, and browse the images in a gallery of thumbnails.

This was my project between graduation and starting work, unfortunately my last checkin was just a couple days after starting my new job.
